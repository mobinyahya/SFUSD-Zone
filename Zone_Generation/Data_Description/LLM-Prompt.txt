In partnership with SFUSD (San Francisco Unified School District), I've developed a code,
to find an equitable and efficient zoning system for elementary school assignments,
using Gurobi for linear programming to ensure diversity balance, contiguity of zones, and compactness look on zones.
The following, is the codebase I have, to generate zones for San Francisco Unified School district elementary schools and students:
I want you to fully read and understand the code, the code structure, the data structures used within the cod.
Then, help me add new set of constraints to the existing model

Your todos:
1- Make sure you fully understand the structure of the data, by reading the code and the comments within the code
2- Make sure you understand the meaning of the columns in self.area_data dataframe, by reading the content of area_data.txt


Read the integer_program.py to get a better understanding on how I implemented the integer programming constraints.
 I mentioned my data structures above, but ll the data is also available in a self.area_data pandas dataframe.
  Columns of self.area_data are mentioned in area_data.py file. Each row of self.area_data is different attendance area.
