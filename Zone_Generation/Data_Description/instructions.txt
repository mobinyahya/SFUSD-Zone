Each zone is a subset of area indices.

For each value j in range(self.A), there is a unique area, with index j.
In other words, each value j in [0,..., self.A], represents a different area index.

Each zone has a centroid area, z. z is also a valid area, which means z is in range(A).

self.x[j,z] is the decision variable indicating whether area with index j is part of zone number z.

To compute a metric (racial, socio-economic, etc) at zone level, we have sum up the metrics at area level,
for all the areas that are assigned to that zone.s
